## Week 02 - Choice Blogging - Abstraction

Abstraction defines much of our perception. For example, you are:
* A student at UNSW taking COMP2511
* You! <Insert your name here>
* A bag of meat (skin, blood and organs)
* A collection of millions of cells
* A collection of millions of organic molecules
* A collection of billions of atoms
* A collection of subatomic particles

Sometimes it is useful to think of you as a student at UNSW taking COMP2511 (in the context of this course for example. Sometimes it is useful to think of you as a bag of meat (for example a doctor treating you), etc.

Take another example, a book. You can think of a book as:
* A story / narrative
* A collection of ideas
* A collection of chapters
* A collection of sentences
* A collection of words
* A collection of letters

In this task you will need to think of, or find an example of abstraction where one thing can be perceived as several different things on a variety of levels. Write a short blog post outlining this hierarchy and giving a couple of examples of how perceiving at different levels of abstraction can be useful in different situations.
