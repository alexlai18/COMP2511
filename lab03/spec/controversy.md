## Week 03 - Choice Blogging - Controversy in Programming Patterns

So far in the course we have discussed a number of programming patterns - behaviours and characteristics, in this case of programming languages that are not just specific to Java, but are common across many languages - OOP patterns of classes, objects, constructors, inheritance/polymorphism, access modifiers, static methods - and also programming patterns of exceptions, testing, generics and collections.

Like any design, programming languages are designed for specific purposes and to solve specific problems - there is no "one size fits all" programming language (at least, it's believed). However sometimes these decisions and solutions can themselves create different problems that make working with the language difficult or divide opinion on the language. As engineers it is important we understand the pros and cons of our possible choices through research and others' experience.

### Your Task

Pick one of the following topics, or if you like research into a topic of your choice, of a programming language feature that has sparked debate and/or controversy in the language community:

Write a blog post containing:
* Your chosen topic and a brief overview of the pattern;
* Why it has sparked debate / controversy; 
* Arguments on both / multiple sides of the discussion;
* Your opinion on the topic; and
* What you learned by completing this activity.

Make your blog post public and post it in the forum under the Blogging megathread. Read through 2 other people's posts and leave a comment on the thread providing them with some feedback.
