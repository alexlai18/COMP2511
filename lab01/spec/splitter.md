## Lab 01 - Core Exercise - Splitter üçå

Modify `Splitter.java` in `src/splitter` such that it:
* Asks the user for a message;
* Reads a line consisting of words separated by a space from `System.in`; then
* Prints out the individual words in the string.

For example:

```
Enter a message: 
Help I'm trapped in a Java program
Help
I'm
trapped
in
a
Java
Program
```

Once completed commit and push your changes.

The pipeline for this repository will run a simple test on your code to check that it works as expected. You can run the tests yourself locally using `bash tests.sh`, though this will run tests for all exercises in the lab unless you modify it.
