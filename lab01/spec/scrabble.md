## Lab 01 - Choice Exercise - Scrabble Subwords ðŸ“š

A new version of the popular board game [Scrabble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble) is coming out soon, and they want you to write a program to calculate the score for a word on the board.

In this new version of Scrabble, instead of the score for a word placement being the sum of the values of each individual letter, the score for the word is the number of distinct 'subwords' it contains, including itself; if the world is not a subword, its score is 0. 

The definition of a subword is recursive: a subword is constructed by removing one letter from a word. For a subword to be valid, it must bein our dictionary and have at least 2 letters. The subwords for a word should only be recursively generated if the word itself is a valid subword.

Let's have a look at an example. The six subwords for the word lion are `ion`, `lin`, `in`, `io`, `li` and `on`. (in our dictionary), and so the final score is `7`. Note that even though `lo` is made up of the letters of `lion` and is valid dictionary word, it is not counted because there is not path of subwords  from `lion` to `lo`. 

Inside `Scrabble.java`, your `Scrabble` class should have a constructor that takes in a word, and a method `score` which returns the score for the word. 

We have provided you with the list of dictionary words.

Your program should find subwords in a case-insensitive manner.

We have provided a complete suite of JUnit tests for you.

### Examples

```java
Scrabble s1 = new Scrabble("lion");
System.out.println(s1.score()); // 7
Scrabble s2 = new Scrabble("bread");
System.out.println(s2.score()); // 18
```

Hint: Recursion is your friend

If you would like the pipeline to check this exercise, go into `tests.sh` and uncomment the line `run_junit scrabble`. This will run the JUnit tests as part of the testing script.
