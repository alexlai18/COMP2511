## Lab 01 - Choice Exercise - Pineapple on Piazza üçï

In this exercise you are going to (start to) implement your own forum! This week you'll complete a simplified version of the program that involves two classes interacting with one another.

We have designed an Object-Oriented solution to the following requirements, with class and function stubs in the `src/unsw/piazza` package. Your task is to implement the functions according to the specification.

**`Post`**

* At the moment, a post is just a string containing a message.

**`Thread`**

* A `Thread` is created with a title, and a first post;
* Posts can be added to the thread
* A `Thread` has a series of tags, which are just strings.  These tags should be retrieved in a sorted fashion (as per the documentation on `getTags`).

**`PiazzaForum`**

* The `PiazzaForum` contains a list of threads;
* Users can search for threads by tag;

### ArrayLists

In Java as well as Arrays, there are ArrayLists - objects akin to a list in python that store a collection of objects that can be dynamically added to and removed from. You can initialise an ArrayList using the following snippet:

```java
List<String> shoppingCart = new ArrayList<String>();
```

### Testing

We have provided a complete suite of tests for you. You will need the Java Test Runner installed to be able to run the JUnit tests.

You can run the tests by clicking on `PiazzaTest.java` in the VSCode project, and then clicking on `Run Test` under the test class or individual function. Don't worry too much about how these tests work for now - you just need to get them passing.

You can put in debugging print statements by using `System.err.println("message");`, and these can be viewed in the `Debug Console` on VSCode.

If you would like the pipeline to check this exercise, go into `tests.sh` and uncomment the line `run_junit unsw`. This will run the JUnit tests as part of the testing script.
