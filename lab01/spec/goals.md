## Week 01 - Core Blogging - Goal Setting & Looking Ahead ðŸ’­

Goal setting is a big part of professional development and personal growth. It's important to have something to aim for. We've talked about the intended learning outcomes and what we teach in this course - but this course is about you! We want you to spend some time at the beginning of the course thinking about what **you** want to get out of the next 10 weeks. 

Create a new Blog Post in WebCMS, and in it answer the following questions.

* What do you want to get out of this course?
* What skills do you want to develop and improve? 
* What do you think will be the biggest challenge of the course? How will you go about meeting this challenge?

If you would like you can make this post private (Course Staff can view only) you can, but we encourage you to make it public and share it with others!

### Summary Comment

Once you have made the post copy the link and make a summary comment in the [Course Forum](https://edstem.org/au/courses/8675/discussion/) on the megathread **Week 01 Blogging - Goal Setting**.

Writing effective summary comments is an important skill.  You make a summary comment so others can find and decide to read your blog post.  

For example:

### Learning Community

You should read some of the blog posts of other students to get a feel for how you are going, to be inspired and learn from their thinking, and to benefit from seeing a wide range of ideas, points of view, and experiences.
