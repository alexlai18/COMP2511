## Week 04 - Choice Blogging - All Bets are Off

Contractual design is embedded everywhere we look, from insurance policies to plane flights, employment agreements - [even our membership in society itself can be considered a form of contract](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/), according to political philosopher Thomas Hobbes.

Write a blog post describing either:
- An example in the news where something went wrong because of failure to adhere to a contract; or
- An example in your own life when something went wrong because of failure to adhere to a contract.

Your blog post should contain:
- The topic/story and what occurred;
- How the contract was violated - whether the **client** failed to meet the **preconditions** or the **service** failed to meet the **postconditions** of the contract;
- Why it occurred; and
- How you think the design could have been improved to mitigate this occurring, if at all.
