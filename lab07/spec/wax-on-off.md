A pattern is a repeated action or behaviour - a common way of solving a problem. Often we learn patterns that at the time to us make little sense or seem to be insignificant, and then later draw on them to solve a problem and understand why we were taught the pattern.

Write a blog post about an example of a pattern, which can be anything that either:

<ol type="i">
    <li>You learned, and only came to understand the relevance/significance of later; or</li>
    <li>Was applied in a real-world scenario to solve a problem.</li>
</ol>

If you are doing task (i) be reflective and discuss:

- What the pattern is;
- How you first taught/learned the pattern;
- What made you come to realise its significance; and
- How you have come to understand the pattern better because of this.

If you are doing task (ii), carry out some research and discuss:

- What the pattern is;
- The problem being solved; and
- How the pattern was used to solve the problem (even better if you can find an example where a pattern from another field/discipline was used to solve the problem!).
