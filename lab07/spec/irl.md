## Lab 07 - Choice Blogging - Design Patterns IRL

In this task, you will need to pick one of the design patterns we have studied in the course so far and find an example of it in real life.

You can choose to do one of two things:

<ol type="i">
    <li>Research/write about a piece of software that uses a design pattern discussed in the course; or</li>
    <li>Discuss how a design pattern we have studied, or the ideas underpinning it is used in a non-software context/scenario</li>
</ol>

In your blog post, you will need to outline:

- The design pattern;
- The scenario/example;
- How the design pattern provides good design, or is inherent in the structure/nature of the example.
